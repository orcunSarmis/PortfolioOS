Refactoring a website code to improve accessibility standards.
• For this project, I refactored the code of a marketing agency’s website, Horiseon, to improve accessibility and optimise their website for search engines. • Accessibility is an increasing concern for organisations with an online presence. It is critical to enhance a business’ visibility but can also have serious reputational implications. Indeed, it is the responsibility of a company to ensure their content is accessible to many users with various needs. • This project contributed to improving the code behind Horiseon’s website to make it more accessible and compliant with accessibility standards. • It was a great opportunity to familiarise myself with accessibility standards which I’ll be able to apply to future projects with similar requirements.

Actions taken to refactor and improve accessibility: • Verified that the source code was accessible using the ctrl + U and/or right click + View Source. • Review that the code used semantic HTML elements and replace non-semantic ones where required. • Increasing the efficiency of the CSS by consolidating the selectors and properties, organising them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements.


• Review the icon and image elements and implement alt attributes to improve accessibility and facilitate website navigation using assisted technology.

• Reviewing colour contrast ratio and ensuring compliance with the 4.5,1 ratio for text content and 3.1 for headers as well as reviewing colour choices to prevent green/blue confusion for colour blind users.

Background colour was changed from #f2589bd to #2178ab to improve the ratio of the ‘Benefits’ section of the website.
